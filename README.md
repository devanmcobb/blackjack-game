Arrays are pretty essential to everything on the web. This project was created with variables which would later be assigned to the cards array, and then reassigned in startGrame() function with new items and then again down in the newCard() function when pushed to the array. 

Another complex/composite datatype this project worked with  were objects like the player object that stores the keys name: and chips: within, allowing it to be rendered to the UI.

Set several booleans, especially for isAlive and hasBlackJack variables, flipping them around in the startGame() function and the renderGame() function to set the stage for the game.

Learned to wrap booleans in the 'if else' conditional statements, which are a major key! Cannot build apps without these statements! 

To make the statements work, used comparison operators like <= or === to help define when to render the code within the 'if else' statement and logical operators like && AND and || OR to check if the boolean values were true or false.

The 'for loop' in the renderGame() function allows to loop through the cards array and render out each of the cards to the UI. 

Learned 'for loops' are a foundational piece in programming because a lot of programming is based on looping through data and doing thing based upon the data.

Used the Math object to create getRandomCard() function by using Math.random to generate a random number, multiplied by a whole number to get greater option than 0.000 - 0.999.
Then used Math.floor to “floor” the number down to the nearest whole number.

The entire project allowed for buliding upon knowledge of functions, but started to explore the use of return statements within the getRandomCard() function to return values.
